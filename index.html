              <h2>My Favourite Hobby</h2>
              <p>
                I am a student and I have also a hobby. My favorite hobby is
                gardening. I have a garden in the backyard of my house. In the
                summer season, every day I work in it. I lose the soil with a
                spade and weed out the grass. I water the plants regularly. I
                love gardening because gardening is an activity that's good for
                both the mind and body. Also, I can get to eat the delicious
                fruits, vegetables, and herbs that I grow.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are two parts in my garden. In one part, I plant different
                kinds of flowers such as rose, China rose, sun-flower etc. I
                feel very happy when the flowers bloom. They spread sweet smell.
                The garden also looks very charming. Another part, I plant
                different kinds of vegetables such as carrot, radish, cabbage,
                cauliflower, tomato, chilly etc. It also gives me pleasure. When
                my friends and relatives come to our home, I take them into my
                garden and show them the garden. They become very happy to see
                it and thank me.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's no surprise that you feel better after finishing off the
                day's gardening work. Working with your hands and taking care of
                your plants on a regular basis can make even the worst tension
                disappear.

            <p>

            <h2>Ten Tips for Staying Safe in the Garden</h2>
            <p>
              <span>1. Wear Gloves</span> Garden gloves will help protect you
              from blisters, fertilizers, pesticides, bacteria, fungi and sharp
              tools. <span>2. Warm Up </span> Just like an athlete does before a
              game, you should warm up before digging in the garden. Walk around
              your garden for a few minutes and do some pre-gardening stretches.
              <span>3. Banish Bending </span> Kneeling instead of bending will
              put less strain on your back. For extra comfort, consider wearing
              kneepads. <span>4. Check Your Lifting </span> When lifting
              objects, especially heavy ones, engage your legs and not your
              back. When you're carrying heavy objects, hold objects them close
              to your body to reducestrain. <span>5. Clear the Air </span> Wear
              a protective nose and mouth mask, sunglasses or protective eyewear
              to help prevention allergy and asthma attacks.
